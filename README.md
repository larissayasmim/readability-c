## :memo: &nbsp;&nbsp; Brief
<p>The Program calculates the approximate level needed to understand some text, according to the Coleman-Liau index readability test. This test is designed to show what grade level (USA) is needed to understand a text. The formula is: index = 0.0588*L-0.296*S-15.8. Here, L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.As the average number of letters and words per sentence increases, the Coleman-Liau index gives the text a higher readability level.</p>


<br>

## :gem: &nbsp;&nbsp; Features
- Calculates the approximate level (represented from a grade, as in school) needed to understand some text
- Prints "Grade X" output, where X is the calculated degree level
